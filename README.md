**What is a cfg.bin files?**

The cfg.bin files (or simply .bin files) are binary files used in Level 5's 3DS games.  
These files are compiled binaries that look like a tag structure and store various variables used by the games. For example, they may contain data of Yokais in Yokai Watch or player data for Inazuma Eleven games. These files are not limited to integer or float values; they can also contain text. This tool is designed to simplify the reading and modification of cfg.bin files.
This tool is built using some parts of the code from Togenyan's [CfgBinEditor](https://github.com/togenyan/CfgBinEditor).
